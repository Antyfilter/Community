# ðŸ§¦ Shadowsocks V2ray TLS

### Setup guide

#### 1. Prepare

1. Buy a simple server (VPS) for 5 dollars outside Iran. [List of cloud server providers.](https://github.com/hiddify/awesome-iran-freedom/blob/main/vps-providers.md)
2. Buy a cheap domain for 2 dollars.
3. Create an Arvancloud account. It only needs an email address and a phone number (both Iranian and international phone numbers accepted)

***

#### 2. Arvancloud setup

1. Log in to the Arvancloud account and add your domain.

```
Domain List > Add new domains
```



Then:

* Enter your domain name
* Select Free plan
* Skip DNS Records
* Note the nameservers presented on the last step



* Go to your domain registrar (the website where you bought your domain, e.g. Godaddy, Namecheap, ...)
* Update the nameservers to the one you got in Arvancloud (after adding the domain).

After your domain nameservers changed successfully (depending on the registrar, it can take a few hours, but it's usually quite fast), your domain is now using Arvancloud DNS.

1. Connect your domain to your server's IP address using `A` records. Make sure the `Cloud Service` option is enabled for each record.&#x20;
2. Go to `HTTPS settings` on the navbar, select `Issue certificate`. It will take around 30 minutes for the certificate to be ready.
3. After the certificate is issued, enable the `Activate HTTPS` option.&#x20;

#### 3. VPS setup

1. SSH into the server.
2. Install docker and docker-compose. Here's a [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) on how to do it for Ubuntu.
3. Open ports 80 TCP ingress and 443 TCP ingress on your server (security group/firewall)
4. Clone the below repo and `cd` inside the folder.

```
git clone https://github.com/WeAreMahsaAmini/FreeInternet.git
cd protocols/shadowsocks-v2ray-tls/
```

1. Edit the `.env` file.

```
# Replace your_domain with the domain you bought, without http, or www in front of it, e.g.: google.com
DOMAIN=your-domain.com

# change to a secure password
PASSWORD=some-strong-password
```

1. Build the docker image and run the containers with below commands:

```
docker-compose build

docker-compose up -d
```

1. Since the container is running in detached mode, you need to check the logs to see the config for your VPN server. (Android and iOS urls)

```
docker-compose logs -f --tail 500
```

#### 4. Share

1. Congratulations! Your server is running now. You can share the URLs with your family, friends and people you trust. You can share this guide for them to start using your VPN server.
2. Alternatively, you can open a pull request to this file to share your server config on this repository so more people can utilise it.
